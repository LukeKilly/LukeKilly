## University Project

This project which I wrote for my University Dissertation explores how to create a program that identifies radionuclides
based on their gamma-ray spectrometry. It investigates the mathematics behind nuclear decay and derives the decay equation. In doing so, this project
provides a structured method in which to analyse gamma-spectra and the
reasoning behind doing so. The importance of this analysis has many applications in medicinal imaging and use by LabLogic Systems. Analysis within
this report contains many details and methods that are useful to this application.
